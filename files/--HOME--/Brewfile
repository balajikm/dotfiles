# These are the common shell aliases that I have setup in the `${HOME}/.aliases` file for ease of running/typing (and also don't need to remember all these commands by-heart!). If you are using my `${HOME}/.aliases`, they will already be present for you. If not, you can then set these up in the respective dotfile of your choice
# alias bcg='brew outdated --greedy'  # List all casks that are outdated like a "dry-run" (and which have version marked as 'latest')
# alias bcug='brew upgrade --greedy'  # Upgrades all casks that are outdated (and which have version marked as 'latest')
# alias bupc='brew bundle check || brew bundle --all --cleanup || true; brew bundle cleanup -f || true; brew cleanup --prune=all || true; brew autoremove || true; brew upgrade || true'
